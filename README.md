# FiveM_Roleplay_Pack
Hi. I am publishing a package of scripts on the fivem RolePlay server. It is reworked by me. The package is well optimized. There are lots of interesting scripts, cars, interiors, costumes and much more. Everything is ready for action. I also send you a tutorial on how to change the names for yourself in scripts and the language

After some time you will probably notice that, for example, it shows "YOURSERVER" in the car keys. You can change this, for example your server name. In the following lines you will find out which scripts require this to be set
